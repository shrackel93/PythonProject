# PythonProject
Academic project: Twitterati and climate change
The project is completed using Jupyter Notebook.

The Notebook file is available in the code for reference.
The other files needed for working with the code are also uploaded to the repository.

To create a local setup of the code:
Step 1: Clone/Download the files from the repository.
Step 2: Create a file twitter_credentials.json in the folder and add the twitter access key and tokens into it.
Step 3: Initialize the jupyter notebook and run the project.

Sample structure of the credentials json is as below,
{
    "ACCESS_KEY": "Your Key Here",
    "ACCESS_SECRET": "Your Secret Here",
    "CONSUMER_KEY": "Your Key Here",
    "CONSUMER_SECRET": "Your Secret Here"
}
